### I. Fundamentals of Networking

#### 1. Network
*   **Definition:** A group of interconnected autonomous computing devices configured to share resources, exchange data, and facilitate communication using common rules (protocols).
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Hosts (End Systems):** Devices running applications (PCs, servers, smartphones).
    *   **Transmission Media:** Physical paths carrying signals (Copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless radio).
    *   **Connecting Devices:** Intermediary devices directing traffic (Hubs, switches, routers).
    *   **Protocols:** Standardized rules governing data transmission (TCP/IP, HTTP).

#### 2. MAC Address (Physical Address)
*   **Definition:** A globally unique, hardware-level identifier permanently burned into a Network Interface Card (NIC) by the manufacturer during production.
*   **OSI Layer:** Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
*   **Format:** 48-bit (6 bytes) hexadecimal format, usually separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
*   **Scope:** Used strictly for local network delivery (within the same LAN segment).

#### 3. IP Address (Logical Address)
*   **Definition:** A software-assigned logical address used to uniquely identify a device and locate its network position globally across interconnected networks.
*   **OSI Layer:** Network Layer (Layer 3).
*   **Format:** IPv4 (32-bit dotted-decimal, e.g., `192.168.1.1`) or IPv6 (128-bit hexadecimal, e.g., `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`).
*   **Scope:** Used for routing packets across different subnets and the global Internet.

#### 4. Summary Table: MAC Address vs. IP Address

| Comparison Feature | MAC Address (Media Access Control) | IP Address (Internet Protocol) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OSI Layer** | Data Link Layer (Layer 2) | Network Layer (Layer 3) |
| **Type** | Hardcoded physical address (Permanent) | Software-defined logical address (Temporary) |
| **Size** | 48 bits (6 octets) | 32 bits (IPv4) or 128 bits (IPv6) |
| **Resolution Protocol** | ARP resolves IP to MAC | DNS / DHCP |

### II. Core Network Devices & Operations

#### 1. Hub
*   **Definition:** A basic, non-intelligent hardware device that connects multiple Ethernet devices in a star topology, operating as a multi-port repeater.
*   **OSI Layer:** Layer 1 (Physical).
*   **Operational Behavior:** Blind broadcasting. When a packet enters one port, the hub duplicates it and forwards it out to all other ports, regardless of the destination.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Collision Domain:** A single shared collision domain. If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision occurs.
    *   **Duplex:** Half-duplex only (devices cannot transmit and receive simultaneously).
    *   **Efficiency:** Highly inefficient; wastes bandwidth and exposes traffic to all connected devices.

#### 2. Switch
*   **Definition:** An intelligent network device that connects multiple local devices and uses hardware addresses (MAC addresses) to forward data link frames selectively to the correct destination port.
*   **OSI Layer:** Layer 2 (Data Link).
*   **Operational Behavior:** Unicasting via MAC table. It maintains a **CAM (Content Addressable Memory) Table** that maps MAC addresses to their corresponding physical ports. When a frame arrives, the switch looks up the destination MAC address and forwards it only to the target port.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Collision Domain:** Every single port on a switch is a separate collision domain. Collisions are eliminated under full-duplex operation.
    *   **Broadcast Domain:** A single broadcast domain (broadcasts from one port are sent to all other ports).
    *   **Duplex:** Supports full-duplex (simultaneous transmission and reception).

#### 3. Router
*   **Definition:** A specialized network device that forwards data packets between different computer networks using logical IP addressing and routing algorithms to choose the best path.
*   **OSI Layer:** Layer 3 (Network).
*   **Operational Behavior:** Routing via IP table. It reads destination IP addresses, references its **Routing Table**, and runs routing protocols (like OSPF or BGP) to determine the optimal path for packets.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Collision Domain:** Each interface is a separate collision domain.
    *   **Broadcast Domain:** Each interface is a separate broadcast domain (routers block Layer 2 broadcasts).
    *   **Functionality:** Performs Network Address Translation (NAT) and packet filtering (firewall functions).

#### 4. Summary Table: Hub vs. Switch vs. Router

| Attribute | Hub | Switch | Router |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OSI Layer** | Layer 1 (Physical) | Layer 2 (Data Link) | Layer 3 (Network) |
| **Address Used** | None (Physical bits) | MAC Address | IP Address |
| **Data Unit** | Bits | Frames | Packets |
| **Collision Domains** | 1 (Shared) | Multiple (1 per port) | Multiple (1 per interface) |
| **Broadcast Domains**| 1 (Shared) | 1 (Shared) | Multiple (1 per interface) |
| **Duplex Mode** | Half-duplex | Full-duplex | Full-duplex |

### III. The OSI Reference Model

#### 1. OSI Model
*   **Definition:** A 7-layer theoretical and structural standard developed by the ISO to describe, organize, and standardize the network communications process between heterogeneous computer systems.
*   **Mnemonic (Top to Bottom):** **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing
